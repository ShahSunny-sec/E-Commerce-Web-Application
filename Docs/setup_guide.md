# Setup Guide for E-Commerce Web Application

This guide will walk you through the setup process for the E-Commerce Web Application, including prerequisites, installation, and running the application.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.x**: Required for running the backend server.
- **Flask** (or other backend framework specified in `requirements.txt`).
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.

## üì• Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/E-Commerce-Web-Application.git
     cd E-Commerce-Web-Application
     ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)**
   - It‚Äôs recommended to set up a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the necessary packages for the backend, which are listed in `requirements.txt`. This will include Flask or any other dependencies needed to run the application:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
- Navigate to the `src/backend/` directory (if not already there) and start the backend server using Python:
   ```bash
   python src/backend/app.py
   ```
- The server should now be running locally (e.g., at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` if using Flask). This will handle backend operations for the e-commerce platform.

### 2. Open the Frontend
- To access the frontend interface, open the `src/frontend/index.html` file in your web browser. This will serve as the entry point to the e-commerce application where users can interact with the UI.

## üìù Configuration Tips

- **Updating Configuration**: If there are any configuration files or environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys), make sure to update those based on your environment.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend server URL (default is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` if running locally).

## üìä Testing the Application

1. **User Authentication**: Test the secure login and registration features to verify that unauthorized access is prevented.
2. **UI/UX Responsiveness**: Resize the browser window or open the frontend on different devices to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.
3. **Backend Functionality**: Use the provided backend endpoints (such as `/login`, `/register`) and verify correct data handling and response.

## üí° Additional Customization

- **Environment Variables**: If you‚Äôre deploying to a production environment, consider using environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database passwords, API keys).
- **Database Setup**: If the application requires a database, ensure it‚Äôs set up and accessible by the backend (details should be configured in the application settings or environment variables).
- **Deployment**: For production deployment, consider using a web server like **Gunicorn** for the backend and a **reverse proxy** like **Nginx**.
